**Diabetes Prediction Application**
**Project Description**
The Diabetes Prediction Application is a web-based tool that utilizes Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical and lifestyle information. Built with Flask for the backend, this application provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

**Features**
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and easy-to-navigate web form to enter patient data.
Real-Time Predictions: Immediate feedback on diabetes risk based on user inputs.
Model Explanation: Display feature importance and prediction insights.
RESTful API: Accessible API for integrating prediction capabilities into other applications.

**Installation**
**Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt


**Run the application:**

python app.py
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

**Usage
Web Interface:**

Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Fill out the form with the required medical and lifestyle information.
Submit the form to get the diabetes risk prediction.

**API Endpoint:

Endpoint: /api/predict
Method: POST
Input: JSON object containing patient data (e.g., age, BMI, glucose level).
Output: JSON response with the prediction and probability.
Example request:**

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"age": 50, "bmi": 28.1, "glucose": 120, ... }'
Example response:

json
Copy code
{
  "prediction": "Positive",
  "probability": 0.87
}
**Dataset**
The model was trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable, indicating the presence of diabetes.

**Model**
The model is a Random Forest Classifier trained using Scikit-learn. The features used for prediction include:

Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
The trained model is stored in the models/diabetes_model.pkl file and is loaded by the Flask app for making predictions.

API Endpoints
Home: GET / - Renders the home page with the input form.
Predict: POST /api/predict - Returns diabetes prediction based on input data.
Deployment
The application can be deployed on any platform supporting Flask, such as Heroku or AWS. For example, to deploy on Heroku:

Create a Procfile with the following content:


web: python app.py
Set up Heroku CLI and run:

heroku create
git push heroku main
The application will be available at the URL provided by Heroku.

Future Improvements
Enhanced UI: Improve the user interface for better user experience.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different models and hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Additional Features: Include more medical and lifestyle features for improved predictions.
Continuous Learning: Implement a system to periodically retrain the model with new data.
